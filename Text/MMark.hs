-- MMark (read “em-mark”) is a strict markdown processor for writers.
-- “Strict” means that not every input is considered valid markdown and
-- parse errors are possible and even desirable because they allow to spot
-- markup issues without searching for them in rendered document. If a
-- markdown document passes MMark parser, then it'll most certainly produce
-- HTML without any unexpected artifacts. This feature makes it a good
-- choice for writers and bloggers.
--
-- === MMark and Common Mark
--
-- MMark tries to follow the Common Mark specification as given here:
--
-- <https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark>
--
-- However, due to the fact that we do not allow inputs that do not make
-- sense, MMark obviously can't follow the specification precisely. In
-- particular, parsing of inlines differs considerably from Common Mark.
--
-- Another difference between Common Mark and MMark is that the latter
-- supports more common markdown extensions out-of-the-box. In particular,
-- MMark supports:
--
--     * parsing of optional YAML metadata block (NOT YET)
--     * automatic turning of bare URIs into links (NOT YET)
--     * strikeout using @~~this~~@ syntax
--     * superscript using @^this^@ syntax
--     * subscript using @~this~@ syntax
--     * PHP-style footnotes, e.g. @[^1]@ (NOT YET)
--     * “pipe” tables (as used on GitHub) (NOT YET)
--
-- You do not need to enable or tweak anything for these to work, they are
-- built-in features.
--
-- The readme contains a more detailed description of differences between
-- Common Mark and MMark.
--
-- === How to use the library
--
-- The module is intended to be imported qualified:
--
-- > import Text.MMark (MMark, (.&+))
-- > import qualified Text.MMark as MMark
--
-- Working with MMark happens in three stages:
--
--     1. Parsing of markdown document.
--     2. Applying extensions, which optionally may require scanning of
--        previously parsed document (for example to build a table of
--        contents).
--     3. Rendering of HTML document.
--
-- The structure of the documentation below corresponds to these stages and
-- should clarify the details.
--
-- === Other modules of interest
--
-- This module contains all the “core” functionality you may need. However,
-- one of the main selling points of MMark is that it's possible to write
-- your own extensions which stay highly composable (if done right), so
-- proliferation of third-party extensions is to be expected and encouraged.
-- To write an extension of your own import the "Text.MMark.Extension"
-- module, which has some documentation focusing on extension writing.

--
-- __Pro tip__: if you would like to pretty-print a single 'ParseError', use
-- @'parseErrorPretty_' ('mkPos' 4)@, because Common Mark suggests that we
-- should assume tab width 4, and that's what we do in the parser.

parseErrorsPretty
  :: Text              -- ^ Original input for parser
  -> NonEmpty (ParseError Char MMarkErr) -- ^ Collection of parse errors
  -> String            -- ^ Result of pretty-printing
parseErrorsPretty input = concatMap (parseErrorPretty_ (mkPos 4) input)
