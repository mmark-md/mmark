MMark (read “em-mark”) is a strict markdown processor for writers. “Strict”
means that not every input is considered valid markdown and parse errors are
possible and even desirable, so one can know that something is not quite
right before looking at incorrect (or rather simply unexpected) result of
rendering. This feature makes it a good choice for writers and bloggers.

## MMark and Common Mark

MMark tries to follow the Common Mark specification as given here:

<https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark>

However, due to the fact that we do not allow inputs that do not make sense,
MMark obviously can't follow the specification precisely. In particular,
parsing of inlines differs considerably from Common Mark. For example, some
characters like `*`, `_`, etc. that must appear in markup in what is called
left- and right-flanking delimiter runs are allowed only in those positions:

```
*Something* is not right.
Something __is__ not right.
```

This produces a parse error:

```
*Something * is not right.
Something __is __ not right.
```

Here is the full list of so-called **markup characters**: `*`, `~`, `_`, ``
` ``, `^`, `[`, `]`. When they appear without escaping, they must form
correct markup structures in inlines, otherwise parse errors will be
reported.

The same applies to the syntax of links, images, etc. For example, it's a
parse error to put a link into text of another link.

MMark also does not support hard line breaks represented as double space
before newline. Hard line breaks in the form of backslash before newlines
are supported.

Another difference between Common Mark and MMark is that the latter supports
more common markdown extensions out-of-the-box. In particular, MMark
supports:

* parsing of optional YAML metadata block (NOT YET)
* automatic turning of bare URIs into links (NOT YET)
* strikeout using `~~this~~` syntax
* superscript using `^this^` syntax
* subscript using `~this~` syntax
* PHP-style footnotes, e.g. `[^1]` (NOT YET)
* “pipe” tables (as used on GitHub) (NOT YET)

You do not need to enable or tweak anything for these to work, they are
built-in features.
