MMark (read “em-mark”) is a strict markdown processor for writers. “Strict”
means that not every input is considered valid markdown document and parse
errors are possible and even desirable, because they allow to spot markup
issues without searching for them in rendered document. If a markdown
document passes MMark parser, then it'll likely produce HTML without quirks.
This feature makes it a good choice for writers and bloggers.

MMark in its current state features:

* A parser that produces high-quality error messages and does not choke on
  first parse error. It is capable of reporting many parse errors where
  makes sense.
* An extension system allowing to create extensions that alter parsed
  markdown document in some way. Some of them are available in the
  [`mmark-ext`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark-ext) package.
* A [`lucid`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid)-based render.

There is also a blog post announcing the project:

## MMark and Common Mark

MMark mostly tries to follow the Common Mark specification as given here:

https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark

However, due to the fact that we do not allow inputs that do not make sense,
and also try to guard against common mistakes (like writing `##My header`
and having it rendered as a paragraph starting with hashes) MMark obviously
can't follow the specification precisely. In particular, parsing of inlines
differs considerably from Common Mark (see below).

Another difference between Common Mark and MMark is that the latter supports
more (pun alert) common markdown extensions out-of-the-box. In particular,
MMark supports:

* parsing of an optional YAML block
* strikeout using `~~this~~` syntax
* superscript using `^this^` syntax
* subscript using `~this~` syntax
* automatic assignment of ids to headers
* PHP-style footnotes, e.g. `[^1]` (NOT YET)
* “pipe” tables (as used on GitHub) (NOT YET)

One do not need to enable or tweak anything for these to work, they are
built-in features.

### Differences in inline parsing

Emphasis and strong emphasis is an especially hairy topic in the Common Mark
specification. There are 17 ad-hoc rules defining interaction between `*`
and `_` -based emphasis and more than an half of all Common Mark examples
(that's about 300) test just this tricky logic.

Not only it is hard to implement, it's hard to understand for humans too.
For example, this input:

```
*(*foo*)*
```

results in the following HTML:

```
<p><em>(<em>foo</em>)</em></p>
```

(Note the nested emphasis.)

Could it produce something like this instead?

```
<p><em>(</em>foo<em>)</em></p>
```

Well, why not? Without remembering those 17 ad-hoc rules, there going to be
a lot of tricky cases when a user won't be able to tell how markdown will be
parsed.

I decided to make parsing of emphasis, strong emphasis, and similar
constructs like strikethrough, subscript, and superscript more symmetric and
less ad-hoc. This is a work in progress and I'm not fully satisfied with the
current approach as it does not allow to express some combinations of
characters and markup, but in 99% of practical cases it is identical to
Common Mark, and normal markdown intuitions will work OK for the users.

Let's start by dividing all characters into three groups:

* **Markup characters**, including the following: `*`, `~`, `_`, `` ` ``,
  `^`, `[`, `]`. These are used for markup and whenever they appear in a
  document, they must form valid markup constructions. To be used as
  ordinary punctuation characters they must be backslash escaped.

* **Space characters**, including space, tab, newline and carriage return.

* **Other characters**, which include all characters not falling into the
  two groups described above.

**Markup characters** can be “converted” to **other characters** via
backslash escaping. We'll see how this is useful in a few moments.

We'll call **markdown characters** placed between **space characters** and
**other characters** *left-flanking delimiter run*. These markup characters
sort of hang on the left hand side of a word.

Similarly we'll call **markdown characters** placed between **other
characters** and **space characters** *right-flanking delimiter run*. These
hang on the right hand side of a word.

Emphasis markup (and other similar things like strikethrough, which we won't
mention explicitly anymore for brevity) can start only as left-flanking
delimiter run and end only as right-flanking delimiter run.

This produces a parse error:

```
*Something * is not right.
Something __is __ not right.
```

And this too:

```
__foo__bar
```

This means that inter-word emphasis is not supported by this approach. (This
is a pity, maybe I should adjust something to allow it.)

There is one more tricky thing. In some cases we want to end emphasis and
have full stop or other punctuation right after it:

```
Here it *goes*.
```

You can see that the closing `*` is not in right-flanking position here, and
so it's a parse error. To avoid this, some punctuation characters that
normally appear outside of markup were made “transparent” and thus they are
regarded as white space, so the example above parses correctly and works as
expected. To put a transparent character inside emphasis, backslash escaping
is necessary:

```
We *\(can\)* have it.
```

Here `(` and `)` are transparent punctuation characters, just like `.`, so
they must be turned into **other characters** to go inside the emphasis.
This is a corner case and should not be common in practice.

So far the main limitation of this approach is the pains with inter-word
markup, as in this example:

```
**We started to work on the *issue*.**
```

Should we escape `.` here? On one hand we should, to close `**`. But if we
do, the closing `*` won't be in right-flanking position anymore. God dammit.

### Other differences

Block-level parsing:

* If a line starts with hash signs it is expected to be a valid *non-empty*
  header (level 1–6 inclusive). If you want to start a paragraph with
  hashes, just escape the first hash with backslash and that will be enough.
* Setext headings are not supported for the sake of simplicity.
* Fenced code blocks must be explicitly closed by a closing fence. They are
  not closed by the end of document or by start of another block.
* Lists and block quotes are defined by column at which their content
  starts. Content belonging to a particular list or block quote should start
  at the same column (or greater column, up to the column where indented
  code blocks start). As a consequence of this, block quotes do not feature
  “laziness”
* Block quotes are started by a single `>` character, it's not necessary to
  put a `>` character at beginning of every line belonging to a quote (in
  fact, this would make every line a separate block quote).
* Paragraphs can be interrupted by unordered and ordered lists with any
  valid starting index.
* HTML blocks are not supported because the syntax conflicts with autolinks
  and the feature is a hack to compensate for the lack of extensibility and
  customization in the original markdown.

Inline-level parsing:

* MMark does not support hard line breaks represented as double space before
  newline. Nevertheless, hard line breaks in the form of backslash before
  newline are supported (these are more explicit too).
* All URI references (in links, images, autolinks, etc.) are parsed as per
  RFC 3986, no support for escaping or support for entity and numeric
  character references is provided. In addition to that, when a URI
  reference in not enclosed with `<` and `>`, then closing parenthesis
  character `)` is not considered part of URI (use `<uri>` syntax if you
  want a closing parenthesis as part of a URI).
* Putting links in text of another link is not allowed, i.e. no nested links
  is possible.
* Putting images in description of other images is not allowed (similarly to
  the situation with links).
* HTML inlines are not supported for the same reason why HTML blocks are not
  supported.

### Additional information about MMark-specific extensions

* YAML block must start with three hyphens `---` and end with three hyphens
  `---`. It can only be placed at the beginning of a markdown document.
  Trailing white space after the `---` sequences is allowed.
